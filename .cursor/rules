# Project Rules
- Always read llms/elysia-llms.txt for framework reference and conventions.
- Also read llms/supabase-llms.txt for Supabase-specific details and conventions.
- API responses must follow the shared response transformer in src/utils/response.ts.
- Follow the Conventional Commits format when writing commit messages.

Commit format:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Rules:
- Header is mandatory; keep under 100 chars.
- Blank line between header/body/footer.
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore.
- Scope optional. Subject imperative, lowercase, no period.
- Breaking changes in footer: BREAKING CHANGE: <description>.

Examples:
feat(auth): add login validation
fix: resolve memory leak in data stream
feat(api): remove deprecated v1 endpoints
BREAKING CHANGE: v1 endpoints removed; use v2
